I decided to work on this website as a side project while i am learning my javascript.
I saw this website on X and it was posted by @ameenai (she is a figma designer) so i decided to take it up
I started this website on the 18th of january and i finished writing the Html
The background color for the website is really not something i think i can do with code but i will try my best while working on javascript 
I will add more info when as i continue the project
